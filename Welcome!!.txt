Welcome to my first repository;
I will be uploading content here as it comes up in my studies. 

I play with everything from bruteforcing basic-ass NCAP passwords,
To creating captive portals for Evil/Malicious Wireless Access Points.
From deauthing drones out of the sky, pranking your friends with SCARY OGGIDY BOOGIDY viruses;
I use the viruses in the context of like "see this? Not dangerous;
Sometimes amateur ransomware has the decryption key in the source code"

I also will do tutorials on setting up a virtualbox private network so you can test viruses and ransomware,
In a safe simulated environment, where no real damage can be caused, but you can test and play with LIVE ransomware,
And study how it spreads and infects through the network and spreads further, and how to decrypt & reverse engineer it. 

I will upload screen recordings as I get them done, please forgive the slow upload rate,
As I'm writing up an entire graph so I can cover everything in separate directories inside this repository.

So without further ado, thanks for taking the time to read this;
