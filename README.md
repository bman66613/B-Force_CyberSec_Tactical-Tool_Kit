# B-Force_CyberSec_Tactical-Tool_Kit
This is the *Official* one and only Repository i will do, 

I will add all of my hacking "bag of tricks" here.

This is mainly for myself as a toolbox i can access from anywhere and run from any device. 
I will have a live malware sample zoo repository(credit will be given to original sources) 
And all sorts of techniques ive found myself, 
Plus some tutorials im gonna whip up to make ethical hacking open source and easy and free to learn and understand. 
Leave notes please!! Notes improve performance. 

Shoutout to Darren and Shannon at Hak5 for making things so easy and fun to learn hacking over the years,
Also a big shoutout to NullBytes for the helpful in depth walkthroughs and explaining TCP/IP to me.
Shoutout to Kevin Mitnik also, for being this weirdos hero since I was a kid!!!
